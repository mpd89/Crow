This limited warranty shall not apply if Licensee is in breach of this Agreement.

Licensee shall provide written notice to ISSI of any claim or lawsuit for which indemnity is sought, promptly upon becoming aware of such claim or lawsuit and in any event within ten (10) days after receiving written notice of such claim or lawsuit.  Licensee shall fully cooperate in the defense or settlement of any such claim or lawsuit, and if requested by ISSI, shall tender the defense to ISSI and permit ISSI to control the defense or settlement thereof, including the selection of counsel.
